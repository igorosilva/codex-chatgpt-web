name: codex-local-scheduler
description: Schedule a prompt to run later or repeatedly in an existing Codex task on this Windows PC. Use when the user asks for a local Codex schedule, recurring Codex work, or a prompt to be queued into the current task at a future time; do not use for cloud OpenAI automations or ordinary reminders that should not run Codex.

# Codex Local Scheduler

Schedule prompts through Windows Task Scheduler and `codex exec resume`. Existing tasks are the default so scheduled work resumes the same Codex context instead of creating a new chat. Definitions and logs are stored under `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\local-scheduler`, which is shared by the Codex app, CLI, and Windows Task Scheduler.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the target task once:
   - Prefer `$env:CODEX_THREAD_ID` for the current Codex task.
   - Accept an exact task UUID or exact task name supplied by the user.
   - Create a new task only when the user explicitly requests one. Capture its thread id from the `thread.started` event emitted by `codex exec --json`.
   - When this skill is invoked from a Web-backed task and the user wants normal or native Codex, use `$codex-native-task-bridge` once. Reuse its returned UUID for every schedule in the same workflow; do not call `Create` once per scheduled prompt.
2. Resolve the requested local date and time in the machine timezone. State the absolute date and recurrence when relative wording could be confusing.
3. Choose a short stable schedule name and invoke [scripts/manage-codex-schedule.ps1](scripts/manage-codex-schedule.ps1):
   - `Create` registers a one-time, daily, or weekly task.
   - `List` and `Status` inspect schedules.
   - `RunNow` executes the saved definition immediately.
   - `Remove` unregisters a schedule only after the user explicitly asks to remove it.
   - `Resume` is the default execution mode and wakes a dormant task to run the prompt.
   - `Queue` is available only when the user explicitly wants to append a message to an already active task.
4. Verify the saved definition and Windows task with `Status` after creation.
5. Report the target Codex task, clickable `threadUrl`, next run, recurrence, state file, and log file.

## Defaults and boundaries

- Use the current task id automatically when it exists.
- Multiple schedules for one workflow must carry the exact same `threadId`. A different schedule name does not justify creating another chat.
- For native tasks, read the target rollout when the schedule is created and persist its model and reasoning effort. Each run must pass those values back to `codex exec resume` so Instant does not silently become the default model.
- The current task id does not prove that its model is native. Use `-NativeCodex` only for a task created or verified by `$codex-native-task-bridge`.
- Resume mode preserves the target task's existing sandbox and workspace. Use a task created with the required write access when the scheduled instruction must edit files.
- Native Codex schedules add `--ignore-user-config`, so the saved global Web GPT route cannot convert the scheduled execution back into a Web model.
- Queue mode uses `read-only` sandbox unless the scheduled instruction explicitly requires repository edits.
- When overriding the model, also pass its compatible reasoning effort with `-ReasoningEffort` so a saved Pro effort is not inherited by an Instant or Sol task.
- Never use the dangerous approval or sandbox bypass flags.
- Do not place credentials, tokens, passwords, or other secrets in a scheduled prompt. Prompt text is stored locally on disk.
- Keep retries bounded. Resume mode retries only failures that happen before a turn starts, preventing duplicate side effects after Codex begins work.
- One-time Windows tasks unregister themselves after a successful queue while retaining their definition and execution log for inspection.
